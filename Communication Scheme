This describes how the code sent from the user to the Arduino's Blue Tooth device will be interpretted.

Functionality goals:
1 - Alarm clock feature.  Start a pattern based on time elapsed
    Needs - Clock function - set base_time by code, set alarm_time by code, set color pattern for wakeup by code
2 - Standard color mixing
    Needs - basic colors
3 - Advanced color mixing
    Needs - predefined patterns sent by code


19 digit code, no spaces
S 010 020 030 030 020 010

P - Pattern mode.  This displays alternating colors with a slow fade

1st digit "P" sets the pattern mode
	2nd digit = color 1 of light 1
	3rd digit = color 2 of light19800000 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
	4th digit = color 3 of light 1
	5th digit = color 1 of light 2
	6th digit = color 2 of light 2
	7th digit = color 3 of light 2
	Where the colors are listed as "1" for red, "2" for green, and "3" for blue, or "0" for nil.
	8th digit through 19th are disregarded.
	The number of colors mode is set by finding the first 0 in the pattern.  For the example of a 1 color mode, the 3rd digit will be 0.  
	
	For example, P 120 000 000 sets a 2 color pattern between red and green.  P BGR 000 000 sets a 3 color pattern from blue to green to red.
	A code of P 0** *** *** will set it to a blank mode where no colors are patterned.  
	
S - Static color mode

1st digit "S" sets the single color mode  (000 being off, 255 being completely on)
	2nd - 4th digits   = color 1 value, light 1
	5th - 7th digits   = color 2 value, light 1
	8th - 10th digits  = color 3 value, light 1
	11th - 13th digits = color 1 value, light 2
	14th - 16th digits = color 2 value, light 2
	17th - 19th digits = color 3 value, light 2
	
A - time management mode

1st digit being 'A' means it will manipulate the time settings.
    3nd digit - alarm on (1) or off (0)
    4 - 8 digits - sets the current time of day
    9 - 13 digits - sets the time of the alarm
    14 - 18 digits - sets the duration of the alarm
    
B - setting alarm colors
    2nd - 4th digits   = color 1 value, light 1
	5th - 7th digits   = color 2 value, light 1
	8th - 10th digits  = color 3 value, light 1
	11th - 13th digits = color 1 value, light 2
	14th - 16th digits = color 2 value, light 2
	17th - 19th digits = color 3 value, light 2
	

1st digit being anything else will result in being cleared until a valid 1st digit is found.
